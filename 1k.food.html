            <p>Korean Food is a delight for the senses that has gained more exposure in the west in the recent years. Originating from the farming and nomadic traditions in the Korean peninsula, Korean food has evolved throughout classic dynasties and current day modernization. Korean cuisine is primarily centered on rice, vegetables and meat. Traditional Korean meals begin with a series of small side dishes that are eaten as an appetizer and with the main dishes during the meal. Gochujang, the infamous fermented chili paste is a staple flavor among various dishes. Many of the dishes highlighted here have their roots in the Joseon Dynasty, but have endured over centuries and have been reimagined in many newer eateries for modern day taste.</p>

            <p>Traditionally eaten on the eve of the lunar New Year, Bibimbap meaning mixed rice, was a dish created as a way to finish off all of the leftover side dishes before the beginning of the New Year. Bibimbap is a colorful dish best served in a hot stone bowl of rice topped with various sliced vegetables, meat and a raw egg (to be cooked as you mix the rice, vegetables and meat in the bowl).<br/><span>Cool Fact:</span> The colors of Bibimbap symbolize specific parts of the body each ingredient nutritionally supports. Dark or black ingredients like mushrooms represent north for the kidneys. Red or orange ingredients like chili or carrots represent south for the heart. Green ingredients like zucchini represent east for the liver. White ingredients like rice or radish represent west for the lungs. Lastly, yellow ingredients like the egg yolk represent center for the stomach.</p>

            <p>Jajangmyeon is actually a Korean-Chinese noodle dish. During the Joseon Dynasty, the Incheon port opened and many Chinese people immigrated to Korea. The Chinese created restaurants in this region and reinvented a traditional noodle dish more suited for the local Korean taste. Jajangmyeon was a dish created by the working class and was an inexpensive dish for all. To adapt the dish to Korean taste the sauce was changed to make it sweeter by adding caramel. Jajangmyeon is made of a thick, handmade wheat noodle with a sauce mad1e of a dark soybean, caramel paste. Jajangmyeon is traditionally served with a small amount of daikon radish, raw onions and chunjang sauce. </p>

            <p>Another dish from the Joseon Dynasty, Japchae, was first made for one of the reigning king's parties. The king liked the dish so much that he promoted the creator to a position equivalent to Secretary of the Treasury. Japchae translates to vegetables mixed and stirred and was originally only made with vegetables. Sweet potato noodles (also known as cellophane noodles) were added to the dish in the early 20th century and have been a mainstay of the dish since. Now Japchae is most commonly served as a side dish at Korean parties and special occasions.</p>
