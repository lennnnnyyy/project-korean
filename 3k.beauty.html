        <p id="beautytext">
Always innovating and pushing the boundaries of style and technology, the Korean cosmetics industry has fast-become known as a global style influencer.  With revolutionary breakthroughs in skin care products such as such as BB Cream and oil cleansers, and trend-bending makeup packaging, such as Cushion Compacts, Korean beauty is driving cosmetic fashion all over the world.  Some Korean women have embraced a beauty style which encompasses both a love of cultivating natural, flawless skin, and using makeup in a distinctive and creative way to express themselves, and to that end, a passionate community of bloggers have sprung up all over the internet.  K-Beauty companies are expanding to the West, with a growing presence in New York City, as well as making their products available online to an ever-increasing market.</p>

        <div class="beauty-pix"><img src= "images/maskmodel.jpg"/>
            <p id="beautytext">Much of the K-Beauty phenomenon revolves around a multi-layered approach to skin care, involving an entire range of different products to address a whole host of issues, with the goal of achieving dewy, clear and youthful-looking skin.  K-Beauty skin care regimens can encompass many (many!) steps, far beyond just a simple cleanser and moisturizer.</p>
            <p id="beautytext">For a sampling of how far you can go in the quest for reaching your ideal K-Beauty dreams (or to see which of the steps might work for you), here are a few articles to spur you on...</p>

        <div class="beauty-pix"><img src= "images/sheet_masks.jpg"/>  
            <p id="beautytext">Sheet masks have been a part of the Korean beauty routine for some time now.  Their popularity has grown so much so that many Western brands have begun making them for their own beauty lines.  A sheet mask is a product-infused cloth that is placed on the face in order to help the lotion or serum better penetrate the skin.  Many people swear by them as a shortcut to a facial, or as simply a way of getting the benefits of spa-quality skincare without the expense and time of heading to a salon. </p>
            <p id="beautytext">Among the many breakthroughs in Korean skin care technology, Eye Pads are small gel patches made to stick on the area just underneath the eyes.  They are infused with products meant to refresh, de-puff and treat dark circles and wrinkles.  These patches are meant for when someone isn't able to get a full night's sleep, or is otherwise in need of a pick-me-up.  They have even been spotted lately being used during long, dehydrating plane flights. </p>

         <div class="beauty-pix"><img src= "images/snailproducts.jpg"/> 
             <p id="beautytext">Along with the kinds of natural ingredients normally used in cosmetic formulations, K-Beauty products have branched out into some very adventurous territory.  A whole range of natural essences, from snail mucin, synthetic bee and snake venom, sea kelp, fermented products, and even starfish extract, have all been added to modern K-Beauty products.  Each of these ingredients is prized for their special individual qualities. For instance, snail mucin is purported to be a skin restorative that replenishes moisture and fades hyper-pigmentation, starfish extract is claimed to brighten the skin, and synthetic venoms are touted as low-cost, natural replacements for Botox.</p>

        <div class= "beauty-pix"><img src= "images/cutepackaging.jpg"/> 
            <p id="beautytext">Korean beauty trends have a very particular point of view, and many Korean women are known for their meticulous attention to detail in both their skincare and makeup routines.  When a new fashion concept is created or discovered in Korea, it can quickly become adopted by women everywhere, and within Korea, many women have been known to take their interpretation of a beauty look very seriously.  Makeup trends among young woman can be imaginative and colorful, such as the current fashion of flushed cheeks, doll eyes and lip art," including multi-step techniques such as "gradient" lipstick application.  Underneath it all is flawless, dewy skin (the Korean term mul-kwang-pi-bu means watery light skin) which at least in part explains the penchant for excellent skin care, with an emphasis on sun protection.</p>
            <p id="beautytext">Along with being innovative, K-Beauty products are known and loved for their coveted, distinctive (and admittedly cute) packaging.  While the skin care and makeup products are nothing but serious, the containers and graphics put a new spin on adorable.  Hand lotion packed in a banana-shaped container, lip balm in a cherry tomato; an eye gel stick that looks like a tiny panda... everything from bunnies to penguins bring a little dose of fun along with the great treatments inside.</p>
